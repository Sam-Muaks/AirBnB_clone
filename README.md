AirBnB_clone

Airbnb. is an online marketplace for arranging or offering lodging, primarily homestays, or tourism experiences. The company does not own any of the real estate listings, nor does it host events; it acts as a broker, receiving commissions from each booking.

The goal of the project is to deploy on our own server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.


Description of the project
We donâ€™t implement all the features, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track at ALX.

This project will be a complete a full web application composed by:

A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging).
A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic.
A database or files that store data (data = objects).
An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them).
The firs part of the whole project is: AirBnB clone - The console

AirBnB clone - The console
The console This is the first part of this project, it represents the data model.

The purpose of this model is to:

Build the data model.
Perform operations like (create, update, destroy, etc) in the objects via a console.
Build a powerfull storage system, that will be capable of storing and loading objects to and from a file (JSON file).


How to start using it
First of all, to use the application you have to clone our repository using the command on your terminal:

git clone https://github.com/Sam-Muaks/AirBnB_clone.git

clone

Once this is done, a folder named AirBnB_clone-master is created, you have to go inside it, using de command cd on your terminal.

cd AirBnB_clone-master

cd

Once you're inside of the AirBnB_clone-master folder, you have to execute the console with the command:

./console.py

execute

Done this, it will show the console of the application, from here, we can interact with the application data.

Examples
Now we are going to show some of the application features.

help command
